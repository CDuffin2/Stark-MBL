Driven-Stark-MBL
Codes for periodically driven Stark MBL system

Included are the following:

Tau.py: Calculation of scaling exponents Ï„_q plotted against q, extrapolated to infinite size using multiple extrapolations based on system size. 
EEV.py: Calculation of eigenstate expectation values both on resonance and off resonance.
IPR_Map.py: Phase diagram of IPRs as a function of both T_0 and T_1.
EEV_Map: Similar phase diagram as IPR_Map but with a calculation of EEV standard deviations rather than IPRs.
